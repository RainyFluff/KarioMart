# KarioMart
The game is an isometric racing game with 2 players, both players need to drive through all the checkpoints on the map in order to get through the goal at the end. The first player to drive through the goal wins.

The first scene, where everything is started is "Main Menu", everything can and will be loaded from there, no additional packages are required. All the code is in the "Scripts" folder. The code itself is simple, not very modular and not easily expanded upon. This is because the project is very small and doesnt require advanced code to funciton.
Some code is a bit more modular such as the "Pick Ups" and "Checkpoints" this is mainly because i saw the approach i took in these scripts to be the quickest and easiest.
All codes design can be simplified to "the quickest and easiest way to achieve my goals without cluttering up the inspector too much"

# Instructions
Player 1 uses WASD for movement, leftShift for boost and leftControl for using Bombs.
Player 2 uses Arrow keys for movement, rightShift for boost and rightControl for using Bombs.
Pressing Escape will pause the game, this works for both players.
